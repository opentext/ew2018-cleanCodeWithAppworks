## Practical Session 3: Clean code with appworks-js

In this practical session we will be using appworks-js to write some example code in an Angular application. We will be looking at an example of use of appworks-js that does not meet Clean Code standard and will refactor this into something more testable.

- TypeScript
- Visual Studio Code
- npm

appworks-js can be used to build compelling mobile experiences as demonstrated by the OpenText applications that make use of its native plugins. In this example we will look at how we can make use of these plugins while maintaining testability and general Clean Code.

## Session Outcome

After this session we expect the participant should

- be familiar with the appworks-js libraries place within an AppWorks hybrid-app
- be aware of structural coding mistakes that affect testability
- gain some exposure to general app development (Angular, NPM, Visual Studio Code)

## Summary

How not to include appworks-js in your project. A frank look at the misuse of the `new` keyword in business logic.
